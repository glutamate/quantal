## Results

In order to determine the locus of phenotypic synaptic plasticity, we
performed intracellular recordings from gregarious and solitarious
fast extensor tibiae motor neurons (FETi). The recordings were
performed at the same time as extracellular recording of activity in
the Descending Contralateral Movement Detector evoked by the movement
of a small rotating disc. In addition, during these recordings we
changed the calcium concentration in order to change the synaptic release
probability.

* here are some epsps

* slow changes in synaptic strength. 

* then used MPFA

* probabilistic methods are known to be able to extract information
  where ad-hoc estimators cannot. Attempted a probabilistic model for
  all the available data.

* lots of data - break model down: noise model, epsp amplitude
  model, quantal model. Later show why this is not only convenient but
  also necessary in this case.

Based on previous work (Ditlevson), we considered an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for the membrane noise. 

* corresponds to membrane equation

* rewrite as gaussian process

* doesn't work

* add independent observation noise - brings sigma down. Can do this
  without latent variables

* differences greg and sol

* posterior predictive

* more accurate measurement of EPSP based on the noise process?

* how to model EPSP waveform: cheat

* gaussian process model

* compare two measurements

* quantify variance (lowess-corrected) across cells
